# ethereum-lottery
A Basic Ethereum Smart Contracts App

To run: `cd frontend && npm run start`

## Fairly Straightforward: 
- Allows users on the Rinkeby test network to send a minimum amount of ether through the metamask browser extention into a lottery pot

- Permits only the contract's manager, the sender, to pick a lottery winner.
